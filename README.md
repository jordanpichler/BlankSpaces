#### What's all this about?
BlankSpaces is a simple app, which fetches coding lessons from a server and presents them. Upon completion of a lesson, the time when you started and finished the lesson is stored to a Realm database. üìù

This is my first try implementing the MVVM design pattern in an iOS app. I also experimented with using RxSwift/RxCocoa in here, but ran into some issues (all that was pushed to the `reactive-experiments` branch). But I also got some things to work and was actually surprised on how useful and simple the syntax was! 


#### Realm Output
See below how three solved lessons would print out:

```
[LessonCompletionEvent {
	id = 5;
	startTime = 2018-11-27 17:41:07 +0000;
	endTime = 2018-11-27 17:41:18 +0000;
}, LessonCompletionEvent {
	id = 6;
	startTime = 2018-11-27 17:41:18 +0000;
	endTime = 2018-11-27 17:41:23 +0000;
}, LessonCompletionEvent {
	id = 7;
	startTime = 2018-11-27 17:41:23 +0000;
	endTime = 2018-11-27 17:41:39 +0000;
}]
```
